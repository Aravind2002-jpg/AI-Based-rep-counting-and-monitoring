I used Streamlit, a Python library designed for people who are not expert web developers, to design an application to use the AI. Streamlit allows you to build data science applications without worrying too much about the UI design, which is all handled by the Streamlit API. I then constructed a Dockerfile that provides instructions to build a Docker image with the running application.
